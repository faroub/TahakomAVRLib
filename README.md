## Introduction

TahakomAVRLib is a C++ library to program Atmel AVR microcontrollers. 
The library make use of the AVR standard C library and is written for easy usage.

Currently, the classes compile on the ATmega48P/88P/168P/328P AVR microcontrollers family. 


## Library structure 

The library is composed of several classes that abstract the internal elements of a microcontroller and some external components that when hooked up to the chip can perform some actions. 

These classes implement the different functionalities and are classified into: 

* Core
* Input/Output
* or Components

Several [applications](#applications) and [projects](#projects)  are implemented in order to demonstrate the library usage. 

A more detailed description of the code listings can be found in the [library documentation](LICENSE.txt)  (generated by Doxygen)



## Software setup  

 Before using the library and start programming and interfacing external peripherals, some software packages need to be installed in your system: 

* binutils-avr: for getting tools like assembler, linker, ...
* gcc-avr : AVR GNU C cross-compiler
* avr-libc: AVR C library
* avrdude : driver program for downloading/uploading code and data from/to Atmel AVR microcontrollers



### Linux

In Linux (Ubuntu in my case), the software packages can be installed as follows:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc gdb-avr
sudo apt-get install avrdude
```

### Windows

In Windows, you need to have the same software packages installed:

* AVR toolchain for windows: can be downloaded from the Atmel's website [downloads](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/gcc-compilers-avr-and-arm)
* avrdude: can be downloaded from [avrdude](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/avrdude/)
* make: can be downloaded from [GnuWin32](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/make-3.81.exe)
* cmake: binary distribution can be downloaded from [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)

An alternative, would be to download the precompiled AVR-GCC toolchain from [downloads](https://blog.zakkemble.net/avr-gcc-builds/) that also include avrdude and make utilities but not cmake.

Before using these software tools, you need to update the PATH environement variable with the file paths to their executables and restart.


## Hardware setup  

* MCU chip either barebone or on a development board like an Arduino UNO
* A bunch of Leds, resistors, drivers, sensors and actuators
* A breadboard
* Jumper wires
* An AVR ISPProgrammer (optional)


## Applications

These applications demonstrate the usage of TahakomAVRLib in simple examples:

* [Blink a Led](applications/BlinkLed)


## Projects

These are relatively complex projects implemented using TahakomAVRLib
